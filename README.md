# build-your-first-slack-app

ðŸš¨ If you are following my tutorial on youtube, you will need to change the request URL to be your remix app.

I.e. you will need to change this line under slash commands

```yaml
url: https://atom-fantastic-olive.glitch.me/slack/events
```

And this one under event subscriptions 


```yaml
request_url: https://atom-fantastic-olive.glitch.me/slack/events
```

And one more time under interactivity.
